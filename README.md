# API Template

This is a project where I wrote a "basic" API-Rest's template for future projects or
technologies I would like to learn (in order to safe time :D)

## Aim

The intention for this project is for show some technologies that I either: use, like, learned
or would like to learn.

## Features

- GET, DELETE, POST, PATH for data endpoints
- A Middleware for create and save logs
- Security in the processing of the data
- A set of commands for repetitive tasks for example: testing, create/delete db, CI/CD, etc.
- A Dockerfile for test/dev
- A Kubernetes configuration for test/dev

## Usage

### Developer

- If you are a developer there is a folder called app/commands where you can find a set
of commands for save time

### DevOps

- If you are a DevOps person there is a Makefile where it can help you with the CD/CI

## Technologies

### Some of the technologies used:

- API-REST
- Python
